    # Example:
    # IV ‚ûî I before V ‚ûî 5 - 1 = 4
    # VI ‚ûî V before I ‚ûî 5 + 1 = 6
# 3. Repetition Rule:
    # You can repeat a symbol maximum three times.
    # Example:

     #III = 3
     #XXX = 30
     #‚ùå Never repeat V, L, or D.
# 4. Placement Rule:
     #Write biggest values first, moving left to right.
