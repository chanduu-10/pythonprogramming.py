# üîπ Step 1: Why divisible by 4?
# Earth takes about 365.25 days to go around the Sun.

# That extra 0.25 day √ó 4 = 1 extra day every 4 years.

# So we add a day every 4 years ‚ûù Leap year.

# üî∏ Step 2: Why not divisible by 100?
# 0.25 is not exact ‚Äî it‚Äôs actually 0.242.

# That means, we are adding too many leap years.

# So we skip leap years that are divisible by 100 to fix this mistake.

# Example: 1900 is divisible by 4 and 100 ‚ûù ‚ùå Not a leap year

# üîπ Step 3: Why divisible by 400 is allowed?
# Skipping all years divisible by 100 removes too many leap years.

# To balance, we say: If the year is divisible by 400, it IS a leap year.

# Example: 2000 is divisible by 400 ‚ûù ‚úÖ Leap year
